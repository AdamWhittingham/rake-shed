Rake Shed
=========

Over time, we all collect snippets of build scripts which we hang on to. This project is a modular collection of the Rake tasks I've found most useful.

What do I do with this?
-----------------------
1. Copy the Rakefile into your project
2. Create a build folder in the root of your project
3. Copy any snippets you want into your projects build folder
4. Copy and edit `build/default.rake` into your project to define your default task
5. Rake away!

Many Thanks
-----------
The majority of the snippets have been written by other people, I don't know many of the original authors to credit them, so THANK YOU to all those smart people who make and share nice Rake tasks for us to use.
